LENGTH = 97

OP: uint8
    The operation code. In this case, 0x00

TYPE: cString (MAXLENGTH = 64)
    The type describes the type of the module connecting. Each module type should have a unique TYPE that is consistent
    between all different modules. This can be thought of as a model identifier. For example, a motor driver for a
    roomba motor might have a type of `ROOMBA_MOTOR_DRIVER_V1`.

UID: cString (MAXLENGTH = 32)
    A unique ID that can be used to identify individual modules. This should usually be the internal MAC of the ESP
    chip in the format of XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

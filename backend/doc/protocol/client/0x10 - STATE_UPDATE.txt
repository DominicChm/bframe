STATE_UPDATE - Updates the client's state on the server by sending value updates.

<OP:uint8><ID:uint16><TIMESTAMP:uint16><DATA>

OP: uint8
    The operation code. In this case, 0x10

ID: uint16
    An ID assigned to the client by the first message received from the server in the `HANDSHAKE_RESPONSE` message.

TIMESTAMP: uint16
    The timestamp the readings are linked to (i.e. ideally, when they are taken). This value should be synchronized
    with the server utilizing `TIME_SYNC` messages

DATA: Any number of <INDEX><data> blocks.
    An update (`data`) to the variable that corresponds with `INDEX`. `data` is of arbitrary length, and can represent
    anything from a uint8 to a char array (string). Variable-index pairs are determined by the core when Module.h is
    generated from a module definition. They must match between the server and client.

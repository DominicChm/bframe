General:
  -Uses UDP and WS elements to handle packetization - Code just deals with raw data.
    -Raw data is sent directly, no need for custom header/checksum/endbyte like in serial protocol.
  -Dead-ass simple
  -Differential - I.E new values sent when updated, not every tick to cut down on network activity.
  -Time is always included with each packet

Format:
    -N number of (<variable_index><new_value>) chunks sent with each packet.
    -Variable index is 8 variables

<command_code><time><time>n(<index>n(<data_bytes>))
